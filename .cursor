# This prompt guides Cursor to generate a full-stack project using MERN + Next.js.
# It enforces clean modular code, comments, and adaptability.

  Build a top-level **full-stack website** using **MERN stack + Next.js** with the following requirements:

  1. **Folder Structure**
     - `frontend/` → Next.js app with pages, components, styles, and utils.
     - `backend/` → Node.js + Express API with routes, controllers, models, config, and middleware.
     - Shared environment variables in `.env`.
     - `docker-compose.yml` for running frontend, backend, and MongoDB.
     - `README.md` with setup and run instructions.

  2. **Frontend (Next.js + React + TailwindCSS)**
     - Proper module separation:
       - `components/` for reusable UI.
       - `pages/` with routing (home, about, contact, dashboard).
       - `lib/` for API helpers.
       - `styles/` with Tailwind and global styles.
     - Include **great animations** using **Framer Motion**.
     - Follow best practices: responsive UI, accessibility, modular imports, reusable hooks.
     - Example: navbar, footer, animated hero section, cards with hover animations.

  3. **Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB via Mongoose)**
     - `server.js` entrypoint.
     - `routes/` for REST endpoints.
     - `controllers/` for business logic.
     - `models/` with Mongoose schemas.
     - `middleware/` for auth, error handling, validation.
     - `config/` for DB connection and environment management.
     - Use JWT authentication and bcrypt for hashing.
     - Implement sample routes: `/api/users`, `/api/posts`.

  4. **Best Practices**
     - Write **clear comments** for each function and module.
     - Use `.env` for secrets (DB_URI, JWT_SECRET, API keys).
     - Implement ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting.
     - Ensure code is modular, readable, and easy to extend.
     - Provide error handling for all async operations.
     - Backend should support CORS for frontend calls.

  5. **Future Adaptability**
     - Configurable services in `config/` so it’s easy to swap DB, add APIs, or integrate third-party services.
     - Use dependency injection patterns where possible.
     - Keep separation of concerns strict (controllers shouldn’t handle DB queries directly).

  6. **Extras**
     - Add `package.json` scripts for dev, build, lint, and test in both frontend and backend.
     - Use TypeScript in frontend for type safety.
     - Add sample test setup with Jest (backend) and React Testing Library (frontend).
     - Provide sample API integration in frontend (fetch posts, fetch user profile).

expected_output: |
  A complete full-stack MERN + Next.js scaffold with:
  - Proper folder/file structure for frontend and backend.
  - Clear comments and readable code.
  - Animated frontend UI with Framer Motion.
  - Backend API with modular controllers and MongoDB models.
  - Config-driven setup, ready for future extension.
  - All code written with best practices for clarity and maintainability.
